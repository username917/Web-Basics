In your starter Laravel application, make sure to update these two files:

web.php - under the "routes" folder
listings.blade.php - the file that we created under the "resources"->"views" folder.

The reason for the error in class was a set of missing brackets to enclose the "listings" array in the web.php file.

At that point, it should work.
